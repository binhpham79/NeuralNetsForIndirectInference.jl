This directory has code which attempts to estimate the CTSV model
using extremum estimation Indirect Inference. It does not work 
well, the objective function has many small wells in the neighborhood
of the global min, which can't be found even with simulated annealing.
Note how the obj. value at min is not zero (though it's close) and how
estimated st. errors are very small (derivatives of moments are large
in abs. value). All of this indicates that true min is not found.
