This directory has the code for the continuous time stochastic volatility
model discussed in Section 5 of the paper.

Code holds the code for simulating the model, which has used to create
the training and testing data set CTSV.jld. This data set is
too large to host on GitHub, either create a copy yourself,
or write to michael.creel@uab.es for the copy used to train
the net.

Data holds the code for processing the SP500 data, to obtain the 
real sample value of Zn. The S&P 500 data was obtained from the 
Ox-Man realized library, at http://realized.oxford-man.ox.ac.uk/.
The data used is from Jan. 2015 - May 2016.

IndirectInferenceEstimationExample holds Octave code that attempts
to do classical indirect inference, using the net's output. This
does not work well, the objective function is too irregular.

AIS holds code for ABC estimation, using the net's output as the
statistic. This does work well.
