300_40.jl is the Mocha input file which trains the 
net.

snapshot-*.jld is the result of training the 
net, it has the hidden parameter values for
the last few training iterations

dataprep.jl does pre-processing and scaling

Analyze.jl gets the final fit from the trained net,
and computes, RMSE, etc., plus does graphics.

The data set dsge.jld is too large to store on github,
to obtain it, contact michael.creel@uab.cat
The data set is created using the make_simdata.m file 
in the GenData directory of the archive
https://github.com/mcreel/ABCDSGE

For an example of how the output of the net can be used
for very quick estimation, see the directory
