300_40.jl is the main file to train the net, compute RMSES, and make the plot.
It requires the MXNet, JLD and PyPlot packages.

dataprep.jl does pre-processing and scaling

The data set dsge.jld is too large to store on github, to obtain it, contact michael.creel@uab.cat
The data set is created using the make_simdata.m file, in the GenData directory of the archive https://github.com/mcreel/ABCDSGE

For an example of how the output of the net can be used for very quick estimation, see the directory SimpleDirectEstimationExample
